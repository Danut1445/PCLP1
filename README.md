# PCLP1

This is a repository that contains two projects from the first year of university written using only C.

## My-Octave
A program that can store multiple matrices. It can multiply them, raise them to a given power and can also use the Strassen algorithm for multiplication. It uses a CLI for the input of operations and for adding a new matrix.

## Image editor
A simple image editor that uses images in ppm or pgm format. It can load an image, select a part of it, show its histogram, equalize the image or the selected part, rotate the image or the selected part, crop the image, save the new image and even apply one of the following four effects: Gaussian blur, blur, sharpen, edge. It also uses a CLI.
